## My process
Given the simplicity of this particular project, I was able to simply divide the end image into containers in my mind. The rest was a matter of playing around with positioning and ratios to achieve the desired look.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

My HTML formatting found itself improving—without the need to format through HTML for the first time, I found myself with an index page that was much simpler and straightforward.

In regards to CSS, much needed practice I needed with positioning was put at the forefront, not to mention a couple of best practices and tricks, like fallback colours, were added to my arsenal.

### Continued development

Most of all, despite the practice and headaches, being able to put problems into words is a skill I need to practice much more. Still not 100% done with positioning, it'll be tested once multiple objects are present.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - Lots of back and forth on basic concepts I was rusty on.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Goes without saying, whenever any obstacles came up, this was my go-to.
